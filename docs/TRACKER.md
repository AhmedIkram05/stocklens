# StockLens — Implementation Tracker

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for implementation progress. Agents read this to determine what to work on next, and write to it when done.
> **Plan docs:** [MASTER_PLAN.md](MASTER_PLAN.md) (architecture), [PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md](PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md), [PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md](PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
> **Domain glossary:** [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) (normative terms)
> **Docs are frozen** — plan docs are the specs. This tracker captures what actually happened.

## Agent Guidelines for Updating TRACKER.md

When updating this file, agents must follow these rules:

### Step Tracker (the table)

- **DO log:** High-level architectural decisions, key files created, validation results, significant implementation choices
- **DO NOT log:** Bug fixes, typo corrections, minor refactors, "R3.x fix" style entries, implementation details that don't affect architecture
- **Notes column:** Should contain 1-2 sentences summarizing the step's outcome, not a changelog of every fix
- **Keep it concise:** If a note exceeds 2 sentences, it's too detailed

### Deviations Table

- **DO log:** Architectural or strategic deviations from the frozen plan docs (e.g., technology changes, schema additions, version upgrades)
- **DO NOT log:** Bug fixes, implementation corrections, spec compliance fixes, temporary workarounds
- **Criteria:** Ask "Would this change the plan docs if we could go back?" If no, it doesn't belong here

### What Belongs Elsewhere

- Bug fixes and implementation corrections → Tell user in chat
- Temporary workarounds → Code comments or TODOs
- Test failures and fixes → Test files or CI logs

## Phase 1 — Backend Foundation + Auth + OCR Migration

**Goal:** Eliminate Firebase and Node.js. FastAPI + PostgreSQL is the single backend.
**Target tests:** 152 pytest (async) + existing 78 Jest (preserved).

Future steps (Terraform, Bedrock) must use `eu-west-2`.                                              |

### Verification Checklist (Phase 1 DoD)

- [x] `docker compose up -d` succeeds with all services healthy
- [x] User can register, login, refresh, logout via API (backend built + frontend wired)
- [x] Authenticated user can CRUD portfolios, holdings, transactions (endpoints built + ownership-scoped)
- [x] Receipt upload → OCR extracts total, merchant, line items → category assigned + persisted to DB
- [x] React Native app builds and runs against FastAPI (no Firebase) — AuthContext rewritten, `api.ts` + `auth.ts` created, all screens updated (LockScreen included in R3.3)
- [x] All 152 pytest tests pass (`docker compose run --rm pytest` — 152/152 pass)
- [x] All existing 79 Jest tests pass (79/79 — updated for API-based receipt service, zero warnings)
- [x] `ruff check src/ tests/` — zero errors (fixed in R3.2)
- [x] ESLint — zero errors
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors (confirmed in Step 10)
- [x] `terraform plan -var="environment=dev"` exits 0
- [ ] IaC security scan passes: `checkov --config-file checkov.yml -d terraform/` and `tfsec terraform/` — zero critical/high _(config written, needs `terraform apply` to run full scan)_
- [ ] Secrets Manager: 5 secrets created and accessible by intended IAM roles _(Terraform config written, needs `terraform apply`)_
- [x] Python test coverage ≥80% _(confirmed 84% via `--cov=src`)_

### Security Checklist

- [x] Passwords: bcrypt work factor ≥12
- [x] JWT: HS256 with ≥256-bit secret
- [x] Refresh tokens: SHA256 hash in DB, per-session, rotation active
- [x] Stolen token detection: revoked refresh reuse → all sessions invalidated (implemented in /refresh, tested)
- [x] Logout: revokes specific refresh token + blacklists access token (returns 204, accepts refresh_token in body)
- [x] Receipt images: processed in memory, discarded immediately _(confirmed in `router.py:187` — explicit comment, no write-to-disk code)_
- [x] All DB queries: parameterised (`$1`, `$2` via asyncpg) _(confirmed across all 39 asyncpg queries in src/)_
- [x] Rate limiting: slowapi + Redis sliding window (20/min auth, 100/min other via config.py settings)
- [x] CORS: restricted via `CORS_ORIGINS` env var _(confirmed in `config.py:35` + `main.py:86`)_
- [x] RDS: `storage_encrypted = true`, security group restricted to VPC CIDR _(Terraform config — apply in Phase 5)_
- [ ] Redis: encryption at rest + transit enabled (cache.r6g.micro) _(Terraform config — apply in Phase 5)_
- [x] ECR: immutable tags confirmed in `ecr.tf:8` _(Terraform config — apply in Phase 5)_
- [x] Secrets: all production secrets defined in `secrets.tf` (DATABASE*URL, JWT_SECRET_KEY, BEDROCK_API_KEY, REDIS_PASSWORD, DB_PASSWORD) *(Terraform config — apply in Phase 5)\_
- [x] IaC security: `checkov.yml` config present; runs blocked until `terraform apply` _(needs provisioned resources for full scan)_
- [x] Terraform state: `*.tfstate` files gitignored (local only — **must migrate to S3 backend before production deployment**)

## Phase 2 — Market Data & Portfolio Analytics

**Goal:** yfinance integration, OHLCV/quote endpoints, per-holding P&L, TWR (cash-flow-based), benchmark comparison (TE/IR), and cash_flows module for receipt-backed portfolio deposits.
**Target tests:** 80+ new tests across `market/`, `cash_flows/`, and `performance/` modules (102/80+ done — Rounds 1+2 complete).

### Verification Checklist (Phase 2 DoD)

- [x] `GET /market/ohlcv/{ticker}` — returns OHLCV data with date range support (cache hit → DB, cache miss → yfinance → DB, tenacity retry on failure)
- [x] Market data freshness accounts for weekends — 3-day staleness tolerance on Monday
- [x] `GET /market/quote/{ticker}` — returns current quote with 60s Redis cache
- [x] Redis outage handled gracefully — quote endpoint returns fresh data from yfinance instead of 500
- [x] `GET /portfolios/{id}/cash-flows` — returns cash flow list (paginated)
- [x] `POST /portfolios/{id}/cash-flows` — creates deposit, validates amount > 0
- [x] `PATCH /portfolios/{id}/cash-flows/{cf_id}` — updates notes
- [x] `GET /portfolio/performance/{portfolio_id}` — returns per-holding P&L + TWR (cash-flow-based) + portfolio aggregate + free_cash_balance
- [x] `GET /portfolio/benchmark/{portfolio_id}` — returns alpha + tracking error + information ratio (with daily_returns_count)
- [x] TWR: cash-flow-based methodology, uses cash_flows for external CF amounts, transactions for holdings state only, BMV=0 guard
- [x] TWR: pre-existing holdings before start_date are correctly seeded from pre-start-date transactions
- [x] ENABLE_TWR feature flag: when False, TWR/TE/IR return null
- [x] Tenacity retry: exponential backoff (3 attempts, 1s/2s/4s) on yfinance failures (Round 1)
- [x] All Phase 1 tests still pass (152/152)
- [x] 102 Phase 2 tests pass (38 market + 14 cash_flows + 50 performance)
- [x] `ruff check src/` — zero errors (33 pre-existing E501 in test files remain, all from Phase 1)
- [x] `docs/TRACKER.md` updated to reflect Phase 2 completion
